# Springboard-Data-Wrangling-Exercise-1
This is the first data manipulation exercise for Springboard's Introduction to Data Science course. 
My task was to wrangle and clean a data set showing product purchases from an electronics store. I had to clean up brand names, seperate product codes/numbers, add product categories, and create dummy variables.
